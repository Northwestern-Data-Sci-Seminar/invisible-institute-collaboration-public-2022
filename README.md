## Invisible Institute Collaboration 2022

This is a place for student teams to open-source their project code from Northwestern COMP_SCI 396/496: Data Science Seminar.  Please share your work as you progress through your checkpoints here.

To sign up for this, please:
1) Create a repo and add your teammates to it (if applicable).
2) Create a pull request to add your repo as a submodule to this repo.

After that, please periodically push the latest version of your code to your repo and we will pull it as we go along.  Make sure to contribute your project presentation slides and your final report at the end of class!
